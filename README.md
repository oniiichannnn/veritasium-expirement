This is the simulation for the prisoner expirement that i watched from veritasium, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA&t=821s&ab_channel=Veritasium

if you want to have a fancier display and have nodejs installed then u can download the repo and run `npm i` to install the necessary packages, run `node fancier-start/index.js`, it will open 2 consoles so u can compare it side by side:

additional feature: specify the amount of simulations
run `node fancier-start/index.js 60` and it will run 60 simulations for both methods, if not specified then it will run 5k simulations
